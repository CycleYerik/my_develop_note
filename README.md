# Introduction 介绍

- 这是我自己整理的一些开发笔记，主要作为自己的学习记录。因为感觉在做项目的过程中，总会遇到很多的问题和困难，也会提出相应的解决办法，但往往在一个问题解决后，缺乏深入的总结反思。为了更高效的学习和提升，决定慢慢将自己做过的工程和项目都进行一些总结，从中提取出一些有用的经验和教训。
  This is a collection of development notes I organized myself, mainly serving as my own learning record. I feel that during project development, I often encounter many problems and difficulties, and come up with corresponding solutions, but often lack in-depth summary and reflection after solving a problem. In order to learn and improve more efficiently, I decided to gradually summarize all the engineering and projects I have done, and extract some useful experiences and lessons from them.

- 其实之前也零零散散整理过一些内容，但分布过于杂乱，于是想着趁此机会进行一些汇总的整理。
  Actually, I have organized some content sporadically before, but the distribution was too scattered, so I wanted to take this opportunity to do some consolidated organization.
